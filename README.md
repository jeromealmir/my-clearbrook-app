"My Clearbrook Village App" is a GIS app that aims to map the current townhouse complex and document the location and data of utility infrastructures, such as fire hydrants, light poles, manhole covers, and parking areas. The objective of this app is to demonstrate an understanding of GIS (Geographic Information System) and to learn new frameworks, such as Next.js and Leaflet.js.
